# Overview: 
This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python 
that allows users to generate QR codes. The application utilizes the Tkinter library for the GUI, 
the PyQRCode library for QR code generation, and the PIL (Pillow) library for image handling.

# Libraries Used:
tkinter: For creating the GUI components.
pyqrcode: For generating the QR code from the input link.
PIL (Pillow): For opening and displaying the generated QR code image.

# Key Features:
User Input: The application provides fields for users to input a link name and the actual link they want to encode into a QR code.
QR Code Generation: Upon clicking the "Generate QR code" button, the application creates a QR code from the provided link using the PyQRCode library.
Image Display: The generated QR code is saved as a PNG file and displayed within the application window using the Pillow library.

# Conclusion: This project demonstrates the ability to integrate multiple Python libraries to 
create a functional and interactive application. It showcases skills in GUI development, 
image processing, and QR code generation, making it a practical tool for users needing 
QR codes for various purposes.
